2. What domain/field? (Healthcare, Finance, Social Media, Computer Vision, NLP, etc.)
3. Dataset size preferences?
4. Which algorithms do you want to prioritize showcasing?

SUGGESTED PROJECT STRUCTURE:
----------------------------
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Apply multiple algorithms (to showcase breadth of learning)
- Compare models using various metrics
- Implement neural network with PyTorch
- Visualizations and insights
- Detailed report with mathematical foundations

NOTE: This file (chat.txt) will be used to track all important decisions, 
progress, and information throughout the project.

DECISIONS & PROGRESS:
--------------------

DECISION 1: Repository Structure ✓
- Created organized folder structure: datasets, notebooks, models, references, reports, project_notes
- Set up requirements.txt with PyTorch, scikit-learn, visualization libraries
- Using Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) for analysis and model training
- LaTeX will be used for final report (managed via Overleaf by student)

DECISION 2: Report Format
- Final report will be in LaTeX format
- We will provide content as text for student to format in Overleaf  
- Will include all formulas, analysis, and findings
- Presentation will be created separately

DECISION 3: Course Materials
- 6 PDF files uploaded to references/ folder:
  * 1.pdf, 2.pdf, 3_new_oct12.pdf, 4DT (1).pdf, 5.pdf, AI_for_Energy_Transition_slides-11.pdf
- These contain lecture notes on algorithms covered in course

CURRENT STATUS:
- Repository structure: COMPLETE ✓
- Course materials: UPLOADED ✓
- Datasets selected: COMPLETE ✓
- EDA completed: COMPLETE ✓
- Next: Data preprocessing and model development

EDA KEY FINDINGS:
-----------------
Dataset 1 (ENB2012_data.xlsx):
- 768 samples, 10 features (X1-X8), 2 targets (Y1-heating, Y2-cooling)
- All numeric, no missing values
- Strong correlations found:
  * X1 ↔ X2: -0.99 (highly correlated)
  * X4 ↔ X5: -0.97 (highly correlated)
  * Y1 ↔ Y2: 0.98 (targets are highly correlated)
  * X5 ↔ Y1: 0.89, X5 ↔ Y2: 0.90 (strong predictors)
- Perfect for regression algorithms

Dataset 2 (energydata_complete.csv):
- 19,735 samples, 29 features (28 numeric + date)
- Target: Appliances (energy consumption)
- No missing values
- Features: T1-T9 (temperatures), RH_1-RH_9 (humidity), weather data
- Weaker correlations (max 0.20 with lights)
- Time-series data (date column)
- Good for: regression, classification (binary split), clustering, time-series NN

KNOWN ALGORITHMS TO SHOWCASE:
- Regression (Linear, Polynomial)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-means Clustering
- Neural Networks (PyTorch)
- Backpropagation
- Various metrics: MSE, R², Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, etc.

DATASETS SELECTED:
-------------------
1. ENB2012_data.xlsx (Energy Efficiency Dataset)
   - Size: 128KB (tracked in Git ✓)
   - Type: Regression problem
   - Target: Heating/Cooling load prediction
   - Features: Building characteristics
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, K-means
   
2. energydata_complete.csv (Appliance Energy Prediction)
   - Size: 12MB (NOT in Git - download separately)
   - Type: Regression + can create classification
   - Target: Appliance energy consumption
   - Features: Temperature, humidity, weather, time-series data
   - Algorithms: All algorithms including time-series analysis

PROJECT STRATEGY:
- Use BOTH datasets to showcase different approaches
- Dataset 1: Regression focus with model comparison
- Dataset 2: Both regression AND classification, plus clustering
- Apply PyTorch neural networks
- Compare all models with appropriate metrics
- This covers ALL course algorithms! ✓

GITIGNORE STRATEGY:
- Small datasets (<10MB) tracked in Git for easy setup
- Large datasets (>10MB) excluded, documented in DATA_SOURCES.md
- energydata_complete.csv requires separate download
- Team members get download instructions from DATA_SOURCES.md
