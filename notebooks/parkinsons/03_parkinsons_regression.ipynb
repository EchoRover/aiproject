    "# Parkinson's Disease - Regression Modeling (Predicting UPDRS Scores)\n",
    "## Stage 3: Training and Evaluating Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What are we predicting in this notebook?\n",
    "We are building **regression models** to predict disease severity scores from voice recordings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**REGRESSION TASK 1: Predict motor_UPDRS**\n",
    "- **What is motor_UPDRS?** Movement symptom score (scale 0-108)\n",
    "  - Measures: Tremor, rigidity, slowness, walking ability\n",
    "  - Higher score = worse movement symptoms\n",
    "- **Our goal:** Predict this score using only voice features\n",
    "- **Why?** Allow patients to monitor disease from home without clinic visits\n",
    "\n",
    "**REGRESSION TASK 2: Predict total_UPDRS**\n",
    "- **What is total_UPDRS?** Overall disease severity score (scale 0-176)\n",
    "  - Includes: Motor symptoms + mental state + daily activities\n",
    "  - Comprehensive measure of disease impact\n",
    "- **Our goal:** Predict this score from voice recordings\n",
    "- **Expected:** Harder to predict than motor_UPDRS (includes non-motor symptoms)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How will we evaluate models?\n",
    "We'll use multiple metrics to compare model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R² Score (R-squared)** - Primary metric\n",
    "   - Measures: % of variance in UPDRS explained by voice features\n",
    "   - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)\n",
    "   - Example: R² = 0.87 means model explains 87% of UPDRS variation\n",
    "   - **Clinical target:** R² > 0.80 (80% accuracy needed for home monitoring)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**\n",
    "   - Measures: Average prediction error in UPDRS points\n",
    "   - Units: Same as UPDRS (points)\n",
    "   - Example: RMSE = 3.5 means predictions are off by ~3.5 points on average\n",
    "   - **Clinical target:** RMSE < 4 points (acceptable for monitoring)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**\n",
    "   - Measures: Typical prediction error (less sensitive to outliers than RMSE)\n",
    "   - Units: UPDRS points\n",
    "   - Example: MAE = 2.8 means typical error is 2.8 points\n",
    "   - **Why useful:** Easier to interpret than RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**\n",
    "   - Measures: Error as percentage of actual value\n",
    "   - Example: MAPE = 12% means predictions are typically 12% off\n",
    "   - **Why useful:** Scale-independent comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Residual Analysis**\n",
    "   - **What:** Difference between predicted and actual values (prediction error)\n",
    "   - **Why:** Check if errors are random or have patterns\n",
    "   - **Good model:** Residuals centered at 0, no patterns\n",
    "   - **Bad model:** Residuals show trends (model is biased)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 Models we'll compare (5 total):\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline (assumes linear relationships)\n",
    "2. **Polynomial Regression** - Adds interaction terms\n",
    "3. **Decision Tree** - Handles non-linearity\n",
    "4. **Random Forest** - Ensemble (expected winner!)\n",
    "5. **Neural Network** - Deep learning approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 What we'll discover:\n",
    "- Which voice features are most important for prediction?\n",
    "- Why Random Forest beats Linear Regression (non-linear relationships!)\n",
    "- Is motor_UPDRS easier to predict than total_UPDRS?\n",
    "- How much error can we expect (RMSE in UPDRS points)?"

    "# What we're doing: Training an ensemble of 100 decision trees\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How Random Forest works:\n",
    "# 1. Create 100 different decision trees\n",
    "# 2. Each tree trained on random subset of data (bootstrap sampling)\n",
    "# 3. Each tree considers random subset of features at each split\n",
    "# 4. Final prediction = average of all 100 tree predictions\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Why it's better than Linear Regression:\n",
    "# - Captures NON-LINEAR relationships (e.g., \"Jitter matters MORE when Shimmer is high\")\n",
    "# - Handles INTERACTIONS automatically (e.g., Jitter × Shimmer)\n",
    "# - Robust to OUTLIERS (averaging reduces their impact)\n",
    "# - Prevents OVERFITTING (bagging decorrelates trees)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Expected performance:\n",
    "# - R² ~0.85-0.90 (much better than Linear Regression's ~0.73)\n",
    "# - RMSE ~2.5-3.5 points (vs Linear's ~4.0)\n",
    "# - Small train/test gap (good generalization)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Bonus: Feature importance\n",
    "# - Tells us which voice features are most important\n",
